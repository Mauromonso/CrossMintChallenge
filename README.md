# CrossMintChallenge

This is the techincal challenge for the **Senior Customer Success Engineer** role advertised [here](https://crossmint.notion.site/Senior-Customer-Success-Engineer-MAD-7f5715cfbc9946c28d82f3361f086f2f).

The challenge [Create your own megaverse](https://challenge.crossmint.io/) consists of two phases, I have solved each phase in Python language, for doing so I have created two separate files:

* MapPhase1.py for Phase 1
* MapPhase2.py for Phase 2

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to run these Python code, you need to install it, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), I have used *Python 3.12.3* for this proyect.

Also, I have been provided with the Candidate ID: 0d321c9b-f123-47d3-8583-98ec8508833c, I have hardcoded it to solve the phases

> [!NOTE]
> The idea was to make the code neater after trying it, ie, putting the candidate ID as a variable, but given the nature of the tests, once it worded I could not go back to test Phase 1, thus, I left it as it is.

Last but not least, the passphrase once the phases is solved:
>Parkour to the moon!
